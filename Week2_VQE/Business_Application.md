# Quantum Cohort Project Business Application

In this project, we use state-of-the-art techniques for solving electronic structure problems on NISQ computers and simulators.

## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise

Beyond just finding the ground state energy for small molecules, one of the greatest feats that we had managed to achieve was the simulation of the bond-breaking for the nitrogen molecule, a much bigger molecule that requires a far more complex simulation than most current day simulators are able to handle. We managed to simulate this in ...

(Jonathan, please help fill this up! I think put down a brief description of how you were able to achieve it)

## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

In this day and age, most of the ammonia that we get are by breaking the bonds of nitrogen we find in air. Most of the current industrial methods of doing so involve energy demanding processes, which drives up cost for businesses in the agricultural industry (due to ammonia being used in fertilizers), in manufacturing of plastics, textiles and other materials, and so many more. It is a versatile substance that is used extremely widely, so by being able to simulate the bond-breaking for the nitrogen molecule, we are able to study the processes required to manufacture ammonia much more easily.


(Jonathan, please help fill this up! Maybe write down how the bond breaking simulation helps us study ammonia production?)

## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved

As the

Examples: 
- Federal Express
- Canada Post

## Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language

Example: By travelling to all destinations via the shortest route, a courier can generate the same revenue that it would have generated following any other route, but will minimize travel costs (e.g., fuel costs). By minimizing travel costs, the courier will be more profitable than it would have been had it travelled through any other route.
