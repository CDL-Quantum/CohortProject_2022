    "## Step 2: Generating the qubit Hamiltonian\n",
    "To proceed to VQE one needs to generate the qubit Hamiltonian, the easiest path is via first generating the electronic Hamiltonian in the second quantized form and then transform it into the qubit form using one of the fermion-to-qubit transformation: Jordan-Wigner or Bravyi-Kitaev.  Next, some qubit operators can be substituted by number ($\\pm 1$) because their states are stationary for the specific electronic state (e.g., ground state). This reduction is very useful for fitting larger problem in a fewer qubit description and is based on Hamiltonian symmetries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 What are the requirements for a function of qubit operators to be a valid mapping for the fermionic operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, recall that fermionic creation/annihilation operators in the second quantization formalism are required to obey the anti-commutation relations:\n",
    "$$ \\{  \\hat{a}_p, \\hat{a}_q^\\dagger \\} = \\delta_{pq} \\qquad \\{  \\hat{a}_p^\\dagger, \\hat{a}_q^\\dagger \\} = \\{  \\hat{a}_p, \\hat{a}_q \\} = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To run our quantum algorithm, we first must transform the Hamiltonian, which is originally expressed in second quantization, as a linear combination of the Pauli operators. In order for the mapping transformation to be valid, we must ensure that it preserves the anti-commutation of the fermionic operators [1]. This is not a given, as Pauli operators do not naturally obey the anti-commutation relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the transformation, we consider the Jordan-Wigner transformation. Let $|0>_j$ ($|1>_j$) denote the unoccupied (occupied) state of the $j$-th spin orbital. For a single operator, the creation operators could be expressed as:\n",
    "$$ \\hat{a}^\\dagger \\rightarrow |1><0|_j = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0\\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{X_j - i Y_j}{2} $$\n",
    "The problem with this transformation is that the Pauli operators do not satisfy the anti-commutation relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an easy and intuitive way to change the transformation so that the anti-commutation relation is enforced. We apply Z gates to each qubit from $0$ to $j-1$.\n",
    "$$ \\hat{a}^\\dagger \\rightarrow \\frac{X_j - i Y_j}{2} \\otimes Z_0 \\otimes \\dots \\otimes Z_{j-1} $$\n",
    "One can easily verify that the anti-commutation relation is now enforced.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 The electronic Hamiltonian is real (due to time-reversal symmetry), what consequences does that have on the terms in the qubit Hamiltonian after the Jordan-Wigner transformation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Time reversal ensures that the fermionic Hamiltonian is real and symmetric. By implication, the Jordan-Wigner transformed qubit Hamiltonian must also be real. If the mapping is performed such that the resulting operators are expressed as products of the Pauli matrices [2] then the assertion that the Hamiltonian be real implies that operators composed of an even number of Y gates are not included. This reduces the set of possible operators, reducing the depth of the circuit.\n",
