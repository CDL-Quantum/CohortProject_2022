## Project 2: VQE: Constructing potential energy surfaces for small molecules

This project will guide you through the state-of-the-art techniques for solving electronic structure problems on NISQ computers.

Open up [instructions.pdf](./Instructions.pdf) to begin learning about your tasks for this week!

**Please edit this markdown file directly with links to your completed tasks and challenges.**

## Tasks include:

- Generating PES using classical methods.
- Generating the qubit Hamiltonian.
- Unitary transformations.
- Hamiltonian measurements.
- Use of quantum hardware.

## Further Challenges:

- How to obtain excited electronic states of the same or different symmetry?
- Partitioning in the fermionic operator space.
- Applying unitary transformations on the Hamiltonian.
- Compress larger basis sets into smaller number of qubits.

## The ansatzer - your ansatz distributor - Business Application

- Different techniques have been proposed for generating ansatz for finding ground states in VQE problems. Our method gives you the ansatz that best adapts to your specific problem. We have distributed ansatz for different molecules that improve performance in terms of convergence and required less number of parameters. We are specialized in big molecules using Tree Tensor Networks (TTN). Give us your molecule and we will tailor the best performance ansatz for it!

### Our Solution for different molecules 

In this section we show the solution of VQE with our special ansatz for two different cases: 
For each week, your team is asked to complete a Business Application. Questions you will be asked are:

| **Molecule** | **Finding Ground State** |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |
| H<sub>2         |         BeH<sub>2            |

- Explain to a layperson the technical problem you solved in this exercise.
- Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve.
- Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved.
- Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language.
