We present our solutions to the CDL Cohort Project Week 2 problems. Written solutions to task questions can be found in `solutions.pdf` as well as in modifications to the provided notebooks. 

Our video presentation and slides covering potential business applications of this technique can be found at the Google Drive folder linked above. 

## Tasks include:

- [x] Generating PES using classical methods.
- [x] Generating the qubit Hamiltonian.
- [x] Unitary transformations.
- [x] Hamiltonian measurements.
- [x] Use of quantum hardware.

## Further Challenges:

- How to obtain excited electronic states of the same or different symmetry?
- Partitioning in the fermionic operator space.
- Applying unitary transformations on the Hamiltonian.
- Compress larger basis sets into smaller number of qubits.

## Business Application

For each week, your team is asked to complete a Business Application. Questions you will be asked are:

- Explain to a layperson the technical problem you solved in this exercise.
- Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve.
- Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved.
- Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language.
