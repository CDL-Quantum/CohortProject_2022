# Business Application for Co-design Approach applied to Superconducting Circuits and VQE

# Technical problem

## Layperson description:

The co-design approach for developing quantum hardware and quantum algorithms aims at tailoring hardware and software of a quantum computing tool stack as efficiently as possible. The previous sentence was a mouth full and let's describe this concept with a simple mental model which we can all relate to:

We may define quality and a well thought out piece of work as something to be desired to achieve if the economic constraints are not too high. For businesses such as making high quality cars, cameras watches it is nowadays also a well working interplay of the hardware and the software stack. Companies such as Tesla, Porsche, Leica , Braun or Casio have taken different approaches to co-design their products with respect to their physical product and the software layer.

There might be similar strategies and approaches we can get inspired by to develop a quantum hardware/software stack, and to compete in the future against othr market players, it will be important to have identified an economical feasible approach of co-designing the elements in this stack while pursuing for high quality, novel and useful tools for the end user.

# Real-world problems

Several co-design examples exist where research groups and companies have tailored the hardware to the specific mathematical problem to be solved. For example the company IQM studied the quantum simulation of nanoscale NMR with a co-design approach [Algaba et al., 2022]. Nanoscale NMR studies are important for medical applications such as improved detection of tissue malformations without the need of applying radiation (X-rays) to the human body.
