## Layperson description:


Similar to soccer, hockey, and other shooting-ball-to-score-goal sports, in a quantum processor spectator qubits can affect player qubits' shooting. A player influenced by spectators' unwanted interactions can make unwanted mistakes. In a quantum processor, even with a few qubits, there are always-on unwated interactions between qubits. A quantum algorithm requires hundreds of perfect and fast interactions between qubits. Mixing these interactions with unwanted interctions makes optimization difficult. We may be able to reduce unwated interactions on the hardware but will never get eintirely rid of them. Facing with this reality makes an opportunity to think of co-designing harwares and softwares, which is our key target. 

Co-designing quantum hardware and quantum algorithms is the key link to make processor reliable for quantum algorithms, aiming at tailoring hardware and software as efficiently as possible. Simple mental examples which we can all relate to are companies such as Tesla, Porsche, Leica , Braun or Casio that have taken different approaches to co-design their products and the software layer. However, they are all approching a unified model to maximize their product efficiency by upgrading their softwares. 

Similar strategies have inspired us to develop a quantum hardware/software stack, and to compete in the future against othr market players, it will be important to have identified an economical feasible approach of co-designing the elements in this stack while pursuing for high quality, novel and useful tools for the end user.

## Hardware under study

Given that superconducting qubnits are the most scalable and tunable harware we use quantum computers based on superconducting circuits.

## Technical/detailed description:

- Problem definition:

Standard gates between a pair of superconducting qubits are far from being perfect. This always act as a limiting factor in front of scaling up the number of qubits in a quantum processor; qubits talk to one another without our control on them. This affects the performance of quantum algorithms on a processor.    

- Hardware-efficient ansatz:

Unwanted interactions are not fixed values and they change under applying gates. Therefore we cannot ab intio measure and identify all unwanted interactions in the processor before applying algorithm on the processor.  However the presence of parasitic interactions affects gates, so that learning parastic interactions can be automated at the same time a quantum algorithm is implemented.

# Real-world problems

Several co-design examples exist where research groups and companies have tailored the hardware to the specific mathematical problem to be solved. For example the company IQM studied the quantum simulation of nanoscale NMR with a co-design approach [Algaba et al., 2022]. Nanoscale NMR studies are important for medical applications such as improved detection of tissue malformations without the need of applying radiation (X-rays) to the human body.
