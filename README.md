### Quantum Bootcamp Cohort Project 2022

The 2022 Cohort Project is an online collaboration bringing together founders in a series of open-source challenges.
During the first three weeks of the bootcamp, the cohort will be split into teams.  These teams will compete on a set of challenges 
designed to engage their science, technology, and business skills on problems related to quantum entrepreneurship.

### Goals:  
* Technical: To explore current and near-term quantum simulation hardware, data, and simulations.
* Business: To communicate the results of the collaboration, and to imagine possible uses of the technology as a solution to a real-world customer.

### Project Legacy:
The Cohort Project is open source, and hosted on GitHub. Each Tuesday morning the teams will 
[fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-forks) 
this repository to their own GitHub account to begin work on the challenges.  By the following Sunday night (11:59pm ET) each team must issue a pull request with their final entry. The CDL judges will review the pull requests, and choose one team's work to merge into the main upstream repository. From that point on it will become part of the legacy of the 2022 Boot Camp.

### 2022 Weekly Challenges
* Week 1: [Quantum computing with neutral atom arrays](./Week1_Rydberg)
* Week 2: [VQE: Constructing potential energy surfaces for small molecules](./Week2_VQE)
* Week 3: [An exploration of the gate-model implementation of Shor's algorithm](./Week3_Shor)
