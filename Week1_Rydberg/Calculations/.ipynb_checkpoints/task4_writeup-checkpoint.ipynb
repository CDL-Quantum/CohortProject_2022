    "### Finally, use your simulations to solve a groundstate encoding problem for an industrial application. Set up a problem, and solve it on as large a graph as possible using adiabatic state preparation protocols. Link this to your Business Application.\n",

    "Inspired by the recent service outage experienced by Rogers, we simulate how the Rydberg atom computer could be used to determine the ideal locations of cell towers which comprise nodes of the service network. We then add redundancy to the network by randomly selecting a node to fail, and recalculating the node placement. A network which consists of towers at all the calculated locations would reduce the risk that Rogers would experience a massive outage in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "To setup an example problem of how this approach could be used, we consider a two dimensional (2D) array of Rydberg atoms which represent the possible cell tower locations. We encode the problem in a bitstring by considering vacant locations to be represented by the ground state and occupied locations by the excited state (that is, the cell tower is built and in operation at that location). Having cell towers at neighboring locations might not be the best use of resources since the area they provide service to would overlap too much. The problem of determing how many, and where to place the cell towers can be represented as a Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. The set of solutions represents all the possibilities of how the network could be constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider a single metric which represents how ideal it is to build a cell tower at a location. A value of '0' indicates that it is not feasible or partical to build the tower, and a value of '1' indicates that the location is ideal. After solving the MIS problem, for each bitstring solution, we multiply the value of each bit by the corresponding metric, and then sum the bits resulting in a single real number. The solution with the highest value represents the ideal placement of the cell towers.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we specify the array of possible tower locations. Our example calculation will consider a 4x4 array. Since only one Rydberg excitation is allowed within the blockade radius, we consider this to model the fact that in a network with no redundancy, cell towers should not be closer to each other than a specified distance. As an example, we overlay our array on a map of Ontario:\n",

    "Our initial goal is to determine where the cell towers should be placed to construct a network with no redundancy. This is equivalent to finding a maximum independent set of our 2D array. The results of our calculations are presented in the following table.\n",
