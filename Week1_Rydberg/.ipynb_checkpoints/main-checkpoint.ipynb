    "\n",
    "This project will guide you through a novel quantum computing architecture pursued by a number of quantum startups, which trap neutral \"Rydberg\" atoms in an arbitrary array using optical tweezers.\n",

    "## Task 1: Adiabatic state preparation with Bloqade\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see [task1_calculations.ipynb](./Calculations/task1_calculations.ipynb) for the calculation details associated with task #1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first task is to investigate Rydberg state preparation in a one-dimensional (1D) chain. The target state, known as the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ state, consists of alternating ground ($g$) and first-excited states ($r$), i.e.,\n",
    "$$ |\\psi \\rangle = | g \\hspace{1mm} r \\hspace{1mm} g \\hspace{1mm} r \\hspace{1mm} g \\hspace{1mm} r  \\cdots \\rangle . $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We found that all 1D chains will have excitations at the endpoints, which is due to the repulsive nature of the excited states. If the number of atoms in the chain is even, then it is not possible to have excitations at the endpoints and still obtain the $\\mathbb{Z_2}$ state. Thus, we investigate only chains with odd numbers of atoms in this analysis and start with the state preparation of 9 atoms. We are interested in the 9-qubit state as it evolves in time according to the Hamiltonian. The average occupation on each site as a function of time is described by the following contour plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "![state_prep](./Images/state_prep.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that the Rydberg densities converge towards the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ ordered state. Unfortunately, it appears that the excited states in the middle of the chain are not prepared to the ideal target state. Further insight can be gained by calculating the expectation value of $< \\sigma_i^x >$ for our prepared state. For both the ground and excited states, the expectation value of the Pauli X operator is equal to zero. Thus, we expect that the non-ideal preparation of each site will result in non-zero expectation values. The further the expectation value from zero, the less ideal the preparation. To investigate this, we plot $< \\sigma_i^x >$ for each site.\n",
    "\n",
    "![expectation_value](./Images/expectation_value.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as we saw with the time evolution, the above plot shows that state preparation is better at the endpoints and decreases in fidelity as we consider states towards the middle of the chain. We also see that state preparation of the even numbered sites is better as compared to odd numbered sites. This is not surprising since both the initial and target states of the even numbered sites are the ground state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we wish to determine the viability of the adiabatic protocol for quantum computing based on Rydberg atom arrays. The adiabatic condition states that the system is evolved slow enough such that the atoms stay in the ground state [1]. The lower-bound for the time required to evolve the Rydberg atom system and stay within the adiabatic protocol is given by the inverse square of the energy-splitting between the ground and excited states $\\Delta E\\,$ [1], i.e.,\n",
    "$$ t >> \\frac{\\text{MHz}}{(\\Delta E/2\\pi)^2} , $$\n",
    "where $t$ is the time evolution of the system. Thus, the smaller the energy splitting, the longer the time required to evolve the system. We can determine the minimum energy splitting as a function of the detuning, for a fixed Rabi frequency:\n",
    "\n",
    "![deltaE_vs_detuning](./Images/deltaE_vs_detuning.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum splitting is found to be $1.61$ MHz, which is shown on the above plot with the dashed red line. For the 9 atom 1D chain and a Rabi frequency of $\\Omega = 2\\pi \\times 4$ MHz, the minimum time evolution is\n",
    "$$ t >> \\frac{\\text{MHz}}{(1.61 \\text{ MHz})^2} = 0.39 \\mu s . $$\n",
    "Next, it would be interesting to determine the dependence of the calculation time on the number of atoms. To that end, we calculate and plot the energy splitting and the minimum evolution time for chains with an increasing number of atoms:\n",
    "\n",
    "![dekta_and_time](./Images/deltaE_and_time.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot on the left shows that even for a small number of qubits, the adiabatic protocol requires a relatively small energy separation between the ground and excited states. This becomes problematic when considering a larger number of atoms, as it becomes increasingly difficult to drive the system while ensuring that it remains in the ground state as required by the adiabatic protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot on the right shows how the minimum time required to complete the protocol scales with the number of atoms. An advantage of this protocol is that the runtime is $O(2^n)$, which demonstrates that the quantum protocol does indeed have an advantage over its classical counterpart. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis indicates that despite a speedup in the runtime, executing the adiabatic protocol is likely infeasible for a large number of qubits. We have seen that state preparation with high-fidelity is difficult for a large number of qubits, and the ability to adhere to the adiabatic requirements in terms of driving the system without exciting the state becomes increasingly difficult for a large number of atoms.\n",

    "### 3.0 Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In graph theory, an independent set means no two vertices in a graph belong to the same set can be connected by an edge. A maximal independent set (MIS) is the largest independent set out of all independent sets. Usually, the MIS problems are NP-hard or non-deterministic polynomial-time hard problems which is unlikely to be solved in a time polynomial to the problem size. Interestingly, this NP-hard problems can be addressed on Rydberg atom arrays thanks to the Rydberg Blockade phenomenon in neutral-atom Rydberg states. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rydberg blockade is triggered due to the strong interaction between atoms excited to Rydberg state. If two atoms are within the blockade radius $R_b$ then they cannot be both excited to the Rydberg state. Independent set constraint means two vertices cannot be both in the independent set when they are connected by an edge. Thus Rydberg atoms can be considered as the independent vertices and the solutions of MIS problems can be efficiently encoded in the ground state of interacting atoms in 2D arrays by utilizing the Rydberg blockade mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Solving 4x4 DUGG\n",
    "\n",
    "In task 3, we follow the steps in [tutorial](https://github.com/QuEraComputing/Bloqade.jl/blob/master/examples/4.MIS/main.jl) to solve the 4x4 DUGG problem. We first create a 4x4 diagonal-connected unit-disk grid graphs (DUGG) with 0.8 filling, by using the random_dropout function. Here, we choose the lattice constant $a$ equals to 4.5 $\\mu$m. Next, we set the blockade radius to be 7.5 $\\mu$m, such that all nearest neighbors and next-nearest neighbors (diagonal) are within the blockade radius. The mechanism of Rydberg blockade only allows one Rydberg excitation in the blockade radius. \n",
    "\n",
    "![4x4dugg.png](./Images/4x4dugg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We first solve this MIS problem using a classical algorithm called Generic Tensor Network. For this specific DUGG, we get the MIS size is 4, and the number of maximum independent sets is 26. Then we solve the same problem with quantum algorithm and visulize the configuration by coloring the Rydberg excitations on the 4x4 graph. The following figures show two cases where the MIS size equals 4 for this specific DUGG.\n",
    "\n",
    "![4x4Bloqade.png](./Images/4x4Bloqade.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, two vertices are on the edge that violate the blockade constraint, this is usually becuase the Rydberg interaction is not strong enough close to the edge of the unit disk to trigger the energy penalty. This can be fixed by running some some postprocessing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The mean value of MIS size calculated by quantum algorithm $\\approx$ 4.16 which is close to 4. This means there is a substantial probability for measuring an MIS state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Parametrize the pulses\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we parametrize the Rabi frequency $\\Omega$ and the detuning $\\Delta$ to optimize our system to get more accurate MIS. We use two methods: one is to add coefficients to the value of $\\Omega$ and $\\Delta$ at each time step; the other one is to smoothen the picecwise linear pulses with Gaussian filter. The $\\Omega$ and $\\Delta$ pulses for the two methods are shown as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Parameters.png](./Images/Parameters.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Gaussian_filter.png](./Images/Gaussian_filter.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "After pulse parametrizations, the mean value of MIS become more acurrate with 4.05 and 4.12, respectively in each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 A Larger Array: 5x5  DUGG\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last step, we generate a 5x5 diagonal-connected unit-disk grid graphs (DUGG) with 0.68 filling by using the random_dropout function. Here, we choose the lattice constant $a$ equals to 4.5 $\\mu$m and set the blockade radius to be 7.5 $\\mu$m. 0.68 filling gives us 17 sites filled with atoms, adding more atoms will dramatically increase the computational time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we first use classical algorithm to calculate the MIS size, we get the MIS size is 7, and the number of MIS is 6. Then we use quantum algorithm, and visulize the configurations by coloring the Rydberg excitations. The figure below are two examples:\n",

    "Inspired by the recent service outage experienced by Rogers, we simulate how the Rydberg atom computer could be used to determine the ideal locations of cell towers which comprise nodes of the service network. We then add redundancy to the network by randomly selecting a node to fail, and recalculating the node placement. A network which consists of towers at all the calculated locations would reduce the risk that Rogers would experience a massive outage in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "To setup an example problem of how this approach could be used, we consider a two dimensional (2D) array of Rydberg atoms which represent the possible cell tower locations. We encode the problem in a bitstring by considering vacant locations to be represented by the ground state and occupied locations by the excited state (that is, the cell tower is built and in operation at that location). Having cell towers at neighboring locations might not be the best use of resources since the area they provide service to would overlap too much. The problem of determing how many, and where to place the cell towers can be represented as a Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. The set of solutions represents all the possibilities of how the network could be constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider a single metric which represents how ideal it is to build a cell tower at a location. A value of '0' indicates that it is not feasible or partical to build the tower, and a value of '1' indicates that the location is ideal. After solving the MIS problem, for each bitstring solution, we multiply the value of each bit by the corresponding metric, and then sum the bits resulting in a single real number. The solution with the highest value represents the ideal placement of the cell towers.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we specify the array of possible tower locations. Our example calculation will consider a 4x4 array. Since only one Rydberg excitation is allowed within the blockade radius, we consider this to model the fact that in a network with no redundancy, cell towers should not be closer to each other than a specified distance. As an example, we overlay our array on a map of Ontario:\n",

    "Our initial goal is to determine where the cell towers should be placed to construct a network with no redundancy. This is equivalent to finding a maximum independent set of our 2D array. The results of our calculations are presented in the following table.\n",
