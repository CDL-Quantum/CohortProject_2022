# Business Application for Cold Atoms Quantum Computing solving a Hubbard model Hamiltonian


# Technical problem

- Graphs

Full stack approach:

- Problem definition

- Quantum algorithm

- Compilation (Processor design / gate implementation)

- Performance analysis: We present an auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations for one-dimensional Hubbard model at low temperature regime to mimic the Rydberg Hamiltonian at ground state. QMC algorithm is intensively employed for calculations of electronic structure of solids and molecules. The calculations are done for a 9-sites spin chain with nearest neighbor interaction and without periodic boundary conditions: the first and the last sites (antipodes) do not interact.

- Hubbard model: The Hubbard Hamiltonian reads,

$H = - \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle, \sigma} t_{xy}^{ij}(\hat{c]_{i \sigma}^{\dagger} \hat{c}_{j \sigma} + h.c.) + U \sum_{i} (\hat{n}_{i \uparrow} \hat{n}_{i \downarrow}) - \mu \sum_{i} (\hat{n}_{i \uparrow} + \hat{n}_{i \downarrow})$

i and j denote the sites which are adjacent to each other.

total density operator $\hat{n}_i = \hat{n}_{i \downarrow} + \hat{n}_{i \uparrow}$

# Potential customers

Potential customers of a simulation tool to predict the band structures of solid materials are photovoltaics companies. With quantum computing based simulations they may be able to predict structures in the future with greater accuracy and obtain the results faster. A high-throughput screening of novel materials with desired properties will help to improve the efficiency of photovoltaics.

In Copenhagen exist two start-up companies which build micro-reactors for nuclear (thorium) heat generation to generate electricity via steam. These two companies are Seaborg (https://seaborg.com) and Copenhagen Atomics (https://copenhagenatomics.com/). Crucial for these micro-reactors are liquid molten salts which act has the heat transport material between the micro-reactor and the water flow to be heated up.

Solid material structures such as graphene, ferromagnetic lattices, Silicium square and cubic lattices can also be simulated with the Hubbard model. Such materials can be found in a wide range of applications such as aviation composites, semi-conductors and specialized coatings.
