- Problem definition:
 Arrays of atoms have been used as simple toy model in spin systems. The simplest model is the well-know Heisenberg spin chain, which has been extended to one-dimensional Hubbard model (Hubbard chains). These toy models have been played an in describing lattice spin models and have also been employed in quantum computing, e.g. in quantum state (qubit) transfer in spin networks. Another system that has recently been of interest is the cold atom system (Rydberg atom). Arrays of Rydberg atom can be exited to their exited state using laser beam and revealed potential quantum computing application, e.g. in quantum enhanced sensing. Coherent coupling between such exited Rydberg states provides an avenue for realizing strongly interacting quantum systems.

- Compilation (Processor design / gate implementation)

- Performance analysis: 
  We present an auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations for one-dimensional Hubbard model at low temperature regime to mimic the Rydberg Hamiltonian at ground state. QMC algorithm is extensively employed for calculations of electronic structure of solids and molecules. Within the auxiliary field QMC the partition function is expressed as a multi-dimensional integral (calculated by Monte Carlo techniques) over a set of random auxiliary fields. The calculations are done for a 9-sites spin chain with nearest neighbor interaction and without periodic boundary conditions: the first and the last sites (antipodes) do not interact.

- Hubbard model: The Hubbard Hamiltonian reads,

$H = - \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle, \sigma} t_{xy}^{ij}(\hat{c]_{i \sigma}^{\dagger} \hat{c}_{j \sigma} + h.c.) + U \sum_{i} (\hat{n}_{i \uparrow} \hat{n}_{i \downarrow}) - \mu \sum_{i} (\hat{n}_{i \uparrow} + \hat{n}_{i \downarrow})$

where i and j denote the sites which are adjacent to each other. 
The first term of the hamiltonian represents the hopping integrals for nearest neighbor interactions indicated by $\langle i,j \rangle$ and the second term, represents the repulsive interaction between electrons on the same site. $t$ denotes the hopping parameter, which describes how favorable it is for electrons to hop from site to site, $U$ defines the strength of the electron repulsion, $\mu$ is the chemical potential.


- Figures [1-3] show the calculated total energy (Kinetic + Potential) for a 9-sites spin chain with nearest neighbor interaction. The parameters U and beta are the Hubbard U and the inverse temperature, respectively. The larger beta=10 corresponds to the low temperature regime to realize the ground state of the system. As seen the lowest energy is obtained at chemical potential=0. The energy increases by increasing/decreasing the chemical potential, and the larger beta (lower temperature), the lower enrgy.

# Potential customers

Potential customers of a simulation tool to predict the band structures of solid materials are photovoltaics companies. With quantum computing based simulations they may be able to predict structures in the future with greater accuracy and obtain the results faster. A high-throughput screening of novel materials with desired properties will help to improve the efficiency of photovoltaics.

In Copenhagen exist two start-up companies which build micro-reactors for nuclear (thorium) heat generation to generate electricity via steam. These two companies are Seaborg (https://seaborg.com) and Copenhagen Atomics (https://copenhagenatomics.com/). Crucial for these micro-reactors are liquid molten salts which act has the heat transport material between the micro-reactor and the water flow to be heated up.

Solid material structures such as graphene, ferromagnetic lattices, Silicium square and cubic lattices can also be simulated with the Hubbard model. Such materials can be found in a wide range of applications such as aviation composites, semi-conductors and specialized coatings.
