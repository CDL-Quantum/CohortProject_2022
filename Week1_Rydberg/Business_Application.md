# Quantum Cohort Project Business Application

## Step 1a: Motivation

Here we analyze another domain of application that is expected to
benefit immensely from the incorporation of MIS (maximum independent
set) based and related strategies. We focus on developing the operations
research-based decision-making framework which can leverage the
strengths of MIS and related optimization problems. In particular, we
focus on the acceleration of transport logistics in competitive,
underregulated markets. Such markets are usually less amenable to
quantitative modeling due to the overdetermined nature of the governing
equations. However, they often have a higher number of predictable
constraints owing to the fact that an evolving framework of regulations
conforms to the established robust, working ones.
