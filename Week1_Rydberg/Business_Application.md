# Quantum Cohort Project Business Application

For each weekly project, your team is asked to complete the below business application exercise.
To complement the technical tasks, please consdier the four questions below.
You are free to format your response to these four questions as you wish (with the final question done as a short recorded video), and to include
the content (or links to the content) on your forked repository.

A brief example for each question is included for the 
[Traveling Salesman Problem.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)

## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise

We improve text summarization by using a MIS problem solution on a Quantum Computer to remove the least relevant words in a body of text. The text is modeled as a semantic graph and the maximum independent set of this graph corresponds to the least relevant words to the meaning of the text. We remove these words to produce an extractive summary of the text. We then produce an abstractive summary of the text by feeding in as input this extractive summary and a knowledge graph of the summary to a generative model.

## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

Extractive summarization has proven difficult for long documents. Companies like YouTube and Blinkist still rely on humans to curate extractive summaries for videos and podcasts. Quantum ground-state encoding allows us to filter out irrelevant information quickly – an NP-hard combinatorial problem that is well outside the reach of classical computing.
Abstractive summarization– generating high-level summaries of text– is the real target. Imagine being able to read succinct and accurate summaries of long meeting notes, or understanding the novelty of a research paper in a few minutes. These are challenges that companies like Otter.ai and Google have failed to overcome. Current abstract summarization techniques cannot handle long text and are prone to “hallucinating” information. By refining the input for abstractive generative models via our quantum technique, we may provide an advantage to any company delivering text, audio, or video to their users. Knowledge-driven industries (e.g. finance and research) have a lot to gain from informative summarization.

## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved

The solution has a broad applicability across both vertical and horizontal markets. The first require an improved text summarization for specific business applications like product review summaries in e-commerce or legal text summarization. The second type of customers are horizontal applications vendors that provide text summarization as a service. 

Established companies:
Otter.ai – effective summarization of meetings
Blinkist, YouTube – no longer a need for human curation
Google – provide high-quality summarizations of website content. A clear advantage over other browsers.
Startups:
Summari – no longer a need for human curation
Hebbia – effective summaries of knowledge-intensive content

## Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language
