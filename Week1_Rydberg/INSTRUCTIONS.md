# Project 1: Solutions

Contributed by Arunanghu Debnath on behalf of the working subgroup.


## Task 1: Adiabatic state preparation with Bloqade

The study was performed to study symmetric detuning range, higher Rabi pulse area. Predictably it prepares a site distribution and not site-specific state profiles.

## Task 2: Larger arrays with the Blockade Approximation



## Task 3: MIS

MIS study was performed by varying the blockade radius while simaltenously lowering the lattice parameter.
