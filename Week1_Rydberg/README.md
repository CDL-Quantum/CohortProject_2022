## Project 1: State preparation and MIS optimization wth neutral atom arrays

This project will guide you through a novel quantum computing architecture pursued by a number of quantum startups, which trap neutral "Rydberg" atoms in an arbitrary array using optical tweezers.

Open [INSTRUCTIONS.md](./INSTRUCTIONS.md) to begin learning about your project for this week!

## Tasks include:
* Simulate the preparation of a quantum state in a 1D Rydberg atom array of 9 sites.  
* Explore the maximum number of atoms for which you can simulate the state quantum preparation procedure, and compare to the *blockade approximation*.
* Find the solution for a Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem using the adiabatic approach.
* Turn your numerical tools onto a problem with an industrial application, e.g. from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08500).

After you have completed your tasks, consider the optional Challenges below!

## Further Challenges:
* Apply a tensor network strategy to the above problems.
* Attempt other state preparation protocols, such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).
* Explore additional business applications beyond the groundstate preparation protocol.
* Employing the appropriate mapping, attempt to run your problems on real quantum computing hardware.

## Business Application
For each week, your team is asked to complete a Business Application. Questions you will be asked are:

* Explain to a layperson the technical problem you solved in this exercise.
* Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this method can solve.
* Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - i.e. a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved.
* Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language.
