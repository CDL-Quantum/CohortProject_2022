## Project 3: Shor's algorithm

This project will guide you through an exploration of the gate-model implmentation of Shor's algorithm and its scaling.

Open [INSTRUCTIONS.md](./INSTRUCTIONS.md) to begin learning about your project for this week!


**Please edit this markdown file directly with links to your completed tasks and challenges.**

## Tasks include:
* Encrypt and decrypt a message using RSA
* Research and implement the quantum algorithm for order finding
* Use Shor's algorithm to factor increasingly large sequences
* Discuss a new quantum-safe protocol as part of your Business Application

After you have completed your tasks, consider the optional Challenges below!

## Further Challenges:
* Try running your implementation of Shor's algorithm on any available quantum hardware
* Explore variational quantum factoring
* Attempt factoring using quantum annealers

## Business Application
For each week, your team is asked to complete a Business Application. Questions you will be asked are:

* Explain to a layperson the technical problem you solved in this exercise.
* Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this method can solve.
* Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - i.e. a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved.
* Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language.

For more details refer to the [Business Application found here](./Business_Application.md)
