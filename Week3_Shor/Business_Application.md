The pharma and health industries are dealing with very demanding data security protection when it comes to novel pharmaceutical recipes, clinical research data with human trials and of course health documents of individuals for optimal patients treatment. This means that throughout the whole domain drug discovery, drug development, drug manufacturing and disease treatment a very cyber-secure infrastructure needs to be provided for numerous entities including companies, authorities, research institutions, hospitals and connected service providers.
The market size for the global healthcare cyber security market was by the end of 2021 $12.6B and will increase by 18.3% from 2022 to 2030. [https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/healthcare-cyber-security-market]

## Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language

Example: By travelling to all destinations via the shortest route, a courier can generate the same revenue that it would have generated following any other route, but will minimize travel costs (e.g., fuel costs). By minimizing travel costs, the courier will be more profitable than it would have been had it travelled through any other route.

**Please store your video externally to the repo, and provide a link e.g. to Google Drive**
