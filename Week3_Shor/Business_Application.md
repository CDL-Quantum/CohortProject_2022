# Quantum Cohort Project Business Application

For each weekly project, your team is asked to complete the below business application exercise.
To complement the technical tasks, please consdier the four questions below.
You are free to format your response to these four questions as you wish (with the final question done as a short recorded video), and to include
the content (or links to the content) on your forked repository.

## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise

Example: Finding a global minimum in settings where a classical approach may not be able to find a global minimum.

In this exercise, we explored public-key cryptography by using the RSA algorithm to distribute asymmetric keys, and we used those keys to encrypt and decrypt messages from plaintext to ciphertext and vice versa. We then implemented a simulation of Shor's algorithm and broke RSA for small numbers by prime factorization, demonstrating the threat that a fault-tolerant quantum computer presents to RSA (as well as to discrete logarithm- and elliptical curve discrete logarithm-based key distribution algorithms). The majority of Shor's algorithm is actually classical in nature, with the exception of one key step: order finding.

We showed that 

## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

Example: A courier has to deliver parcels to several locations and is looking to minimize its travel time. (e.g., “the travelling salesman problem”).

## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved

Examples: 
- Federal Express
- Canada Post

## Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language

Example: By travelling to all destinations via the shortest route, a courier can generate the same revenue that it would have generated following any other route, but will minimize travel costs (e.g., fuel costs). By minimizing travel costs, the courier will be more profitable than it would have been had it travelled through any other route.
