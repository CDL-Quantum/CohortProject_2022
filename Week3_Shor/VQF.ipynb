    "\n",
    "Looking at the original paper [variational quantum factoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08927)) and the experiments performed by  [mstechly](https://github.com/mstechly/vqf) we find the following- \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As $m$ gets bigger the the number of qubits needed to factor $m = p \\times q$ icreases rapidly without classical preprocessing. With classical preprocessing however the number of qubits increases much more slowly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Further elaborating on the above if we don't know the length of $p, q$ the qubit scaling (with classical preprocessing)  in advance is worse that compared to the case when the  length of $p, q$ is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The closeness of the VQF results tothe exact result crucially depends of the choice of $m$. For certain numbers the VQF results are very close to the exact one, whereas for others its very bad (see FIG. 2. in [variational quantum factoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08927)).   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The number of BFGS function evaluations increases withthe number of circuit layers (see FIG. 3. in [variational quantum factoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08927)). (The scaling is approximately linear.) \n",
